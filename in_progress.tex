    ``Mitigating Climate Change Requires Integrated Policy Analysis.'' 
    
    This paper discusses the role of behavioral sciences in understanding and analyzing greenhouse gas mitigation policies, the prospect for improving economic
    integrated assessment models by improving their treatment of behavioral economics and decision-making, and offers guidance on best-practices for the IPCC to
    incorporate behavioral science approaches in its sixth assessment report.
    
    This is a rough draft; work in progress.

    This paper focuses on a statistical analysis of the association between extreme weather (as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Indices) and 
    incidence of marriage and the age of the female partner, as recorded by a survey of 1695 households in nine communities in southwestern Bangladesh. My role in this
    has been acquiring and analyzing daily weather data from Bangladesh to assess the incidence of extreme temperature and precipitation events from 1961--2018.
    
    This is work in progress. We have a rough draft of a manuscript and Carrico presented a preliminary version at the 2019 annual meeting of the Population Association of America,
    but additional data analysis is necessary before it will be ready to submit.
