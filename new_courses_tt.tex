\item ``Data Science Methods for Smart Cities Applications,'' A new interdisciplinary University Course launched in Spring 2018. With Abhishek Dubey (Computer Science), Gautam Biswas (Computer Science), Mark Ellingham (Math), David Kosson (Civil and Environmental Engineering), and Claire Smrekar (Public Policy and Education). 
\item ``Global Climate Change,'' \textsc{ees 3310/5310}. Introduced Fall 2017. Expanded my course \textsc{ees 2110/5110} to cover material at a higher level and add a laboratory (increasing from 3 to 4 credit hours).
The laboratory is largely computational and introduces students to principles and practices of reproducible research using R and RMarkdown. Laboratory exercises include downloading and analyzing climate data
from major online archives; conducting computational experiments using simple models of radiative transfer, geochemical carbon cycle, etc., and analyzing the model output; and analyzing energy demand and \ce{CO2} emissions to assess different emission-mitigation policies. Course and laboratory materials are available at \url{https://ees3310.jgilligan.org}.
\item ``Agent- and Individual-Based Computational Modeling'' \textsc{ees 4760/5760}, Introduced Spring 2016. Agent-based computational modeling with emphasis on emergent phenomena and applications in environmental science, ecology, economics, public health, and urban planning. Course materials are available at \url{https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/}
